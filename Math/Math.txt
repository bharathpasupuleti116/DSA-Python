1. Prime Number

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and itself .
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

Think of a number as a special treasure box. Prime numbers only have two keys to open it:

the key "1" and the key that's the number itself. If there are other keys, it's not prime! Checking if a number is prime: You try dividing it by numbers from 2 up to its square root.If none divide it exactly, it's prime.

Time complexity: About O(✓n) — because you only check up to the square root of the number.

Space complexity: O(1) — only a few variables to keep track.

Why important?
Used in cryptography, hashing, and many algorithms.
