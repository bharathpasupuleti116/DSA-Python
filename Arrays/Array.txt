What is Array?

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, in contiguous memory locations. Each element in an array is accessed by its index or position within the array.

Properties of Arrays:

1. Fixed Size:

The size of an array is fixed at the time of declaration and cannot be changed dynamically

Array Declartion

arr[5] --->  Size of Array =5

arr[5] = [1,2,3,4,5]

2. Homogenous Elements:

Arrays usually store elements of the same data type.This means all elements in an array are of the same type, such as integers, characters, or objects.

arr = [4,6,2,5,3,1]

arr = [a,z,x,b,l,c]

3. Contiguous Memory:

Elements in an array are stored in adjacent memory locations, which allows for efficient memory access and manipulation.

arr = [4   6   2   5   3   1]
      100 101 102 103 104 105

Array Operations:

• Accessing Elements
• Insertion
• Deletion
• Traversal
• Searching
• Update
• Display
