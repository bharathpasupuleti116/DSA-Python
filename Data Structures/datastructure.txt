What is Data Structure?

--> A Data Structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer's memory so that it can be used effectively by program code.

Examples: libaries which contains lot of books in a particular sequential order like A-Z, year wise, etc

--> Software = programs + data

what is data?
collection of raw facts(information).the data like be pdf,images,videos,etc.

what is Programs?
Programs = set of instructions to manipulate data

Why Data Structures are important?

Data structures can offer many benefits :
l. Efficient Storage and Retrieval
2. Algorithm Performance
3. Reusability and Abstraction
4.Data structures help in solving complex problems
5. Understanding data structures allows programmers to design scalable software.

How to Pick Data Structure?

Choosing the proper data structure for each task is also important.
Five factors to consider when picking a data structure:
I. What kind of information will be stored?
2. How will that information be used?
3. Where should data persist, or be kept, after it is created?
4. What is the best way to organize the data?
5. What aspects of memory and storage reservation management should be
considered?

Purpose of Data Structure:
1. Storing data
2. Managing data
3. Data exchange
4. Ordering and sorting
5. Indexing
6. Searching

Characteristics of Data Structure:
l. Linear or Non-Linear
2. Static and Dynamic
3. Time Complexity
4. Correctness
5. Space Complexity
