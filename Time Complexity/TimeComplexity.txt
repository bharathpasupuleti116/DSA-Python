Scenario: Delivering Pizza

You're a delivery person, and you need to deliver to n houses

Constant - 0(1):
If your boss asks you to deliver a pizza to the first house on the list,
it doesn't matter how many houses are on the list
you go directly to that one house.

Linear - O(n):
If you need to pizza to the houses, you'll visit each house one by one.
The time it takes increases the number Of houses.

Quadratic Time - O(n^2):
If you try to check every possible pair of houses to decide the shortest delivery route.
the number of coearisons rapidly as the number of houses increases.

Logarithmic Time - O(log n):
If the houses are organized in a tree-Like structure (e.g.,one main road branching into smaller streets),
you can deliver faster by your search:

First, decide which street.
Then, decide which block.
Finally, deliver to the house.

O(1): Always takes the same time.
O(n): Grows Linearly with input size.
O(n^2): Grows quadratically with nested Loops.
O(log n): Grows slowly, cutting the problem in half each time.
O(2^n):Grows exponentially, doubling the work at every step.
